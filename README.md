Dataset Description and Project Introduction

This project is based on a healthcare-related dataset focused on fever, patient health conditions, environmental factors, and medicine recommendations. The dataset contains information about patients suffering from fever and includes medical and lifestyle attributes that can affect health and treatment decisions. It includes details such as age, temperature, BMI, heart rate, humidity, AQI, fever severity, headache, fatigue, body ache, smoking history, alcohol consumption, physical activity, chronic conditions, allergies, previous medication, and recommended medication. The dataset consists of 1000 records and 20 columns, providing a comprehensive view of patient health, symptoms, and environmental conditions. The purpose of using this dataset was to analyze health patterns, perform data preprocessing, and train machine learning models to understand temperature behavior and support medical recommendation analysis.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The first step of the project involved loading and understanding the dataset. The shape, structure, and data types were checked to ensure the dataset was properly structured. Missing values and duplicate records were also identified. It was observed that only the Previous_Medication column contained missing values. A total of 237 missing values were found in this column. These missing values were handled using the mode (most frequent value) method so that the dataset would remain consistent without losing important records. After filling missing values, the dataset was rechecked and confirmed to have no null values. Duplicate records were also verified and handled to maintain data quality. After cleaning, the dataset became fully usable for analysis and modeling.

Outlier Handling and Data Transformation

Outliers in numeric features such as Temperature, Age, BMI, Humidity, AQI, and Heart_Rate were handled using the IQR method. Instead of removing rows, outliers were capped within acceptable lower and upper bounds to preserve all data points while preventing extreme values from affecting model performance. Histograms were generated before and after outlier handling to visually confirm that the distributions became more balanced and suitable for machine learning. After outlier treatment, categorical features were converted into numerical form using label encoding. New encoded columns were created so that original data remained safe. This transformation allowed machine learning algorithms to process categorical information effectively.

Normalization and Statistical Analysis

All numeric features were normalized using standard scaling so that each feature had a similar range and scale. This step improved model performance and stability. A Shapiro–Wilk test was applied to check normality before and after normalization. Histograms with KDE curves were plotted to visually inspect data distributions. Spearman correlation analysis was then performed to identify relationships between features. Correlation matrices and heatmaps were generated to highlight strong and weak relationships among variables. After preprocessing and normalization, the final cleaned and normalized dataset contained 1000 rows and 20 columns and was ready for machine learning.

Train-Test Split and Feature Engineering

The dataset was divided into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio. The training dataset contained 800 rows while the testing dataset contained 200 rows. Feature engineering was performed only on the training dataset to avoid data leakage. Several meaningful features were created to improve model learning. A health interaction feature combining temperature and heart rate was generated. An environmental stress score combining temperature, humidity, and AQI was created. BMI was converted into risk categories. A symptom severity score was generated by combining fever severity, headache, body ache, and fatigue. A lifestyle risk score was also created using smoking history, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. These engineered features increased the predictive power of the dataset and improved model understanding of health conditions.

Feature Selection and Model Training

Feature selection was performed using Spearman correlation with temperature as the target variable. Only those features were selected that had strong correlation and statistically significant p-values. This ensured that irrelevant features were removed and only important predictors were used for model training. Two types of models were trained using the selected features. For classification, temperature values were converted into three classes and an XGBoost classifier was trained. The model achieved strong accuracy and balanced precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrix, ROC curve, precision-recall curve, feature importance graph, and prediction comparison plots were generated to evaluate performance. For regression, a Ridge regression model was trained to predict temperature as a continuous value. The regression model produced stable results with low RMSE and MAE and a good R² score. Residual plots, prediction plots, and coefficient importance graphs were generated for evaluation.

Project Outputs and Results

As a result of this project, multiple outputs were generated. A fully cleaned and normalized dataset was prepared. Separate train and test datasets were created. A feature-engineered dataset with additional health indicators was generated. A final dataset containing only selected important features was produced. A trained XGBoost classification model was saved along with its evaluation metrics and prediction results. A Ridge regression model was also trained and evaluated, and its metrics and predictions were saved. The classification model successfully predicted temperature classes with strong accuracy and balanced performance, while the regression model accurately predicted temperature values with low error rates and good reliability.

Overall Project Summary

Overall, this project involved building a complete professional machine learning pipeline starting from raw healthcare data to final trained models. The work included data understanding, cleaning, missing value handling, outlier treatment, encoding, normalization, statistical analysis, feature engineering, feature selection, and model training. By training classification and regression models on the processed data, meaningful predictions and insights were generated regarding patient temperature and health conditions. The trained models demonstrate how machine learning can support healthcare analysis by identifying patterns in symptoms, environment, and lifestyle factors. This project shows that the processed dataset and trained models are helpful for understanding fever-related health patterns and can be used as a strong foundation for further medical recommendation systems and predictive healthcare applications.
